# AI-Driven Figma-to-Code Workflow

This project outlines a multi-stage workflow to automate the process of UI/UX design to front-end development using Figma and AI tools. The process is divided into four key stages:

---

## ðŸš€ Stages Overview

### **Stage 1: Figma Generation via AI**
- A complete Figma design is generated based on user input through a single prompt.
- Tools like **Deepseek**, **ChatGPT**, or **Gemini AI** are used to:
  - Generate images, icons, and text styling.
  - Build a cohesive and responsive UI.
- The entire Figma file can be exported and downloaded directly by the user.

### **Stage 2: Asset Export**
- From the generated Figma:
  - All assets including **icons**, **images**, and **text elements** can be **individually downloaded or exported**.
  - Ensures reusability and flexibility for developers and designers.

### **Stage 3: Code Generation in React**
- The AI reads and interprets the Figma design.
- Generates a **fully functional front-end codebase** in **React.js**.
- Output includes component structures, layouts, and basic logic based on the design.

### **Stage 4: Multi-Framework Code Export**
- Beyond React, the AI can regenerate the code using different frameworks and styling approaches:
  - **CSS Frameworks**: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, etc.
  - **Frontend Languages**: Planned support for additional languages and frameworks.
- Offers flexibility based on project needs or developer preferences.
